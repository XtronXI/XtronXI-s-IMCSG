# [XtronXI's *The Idiot's Guide to Minecraft Server*](/)

---

I bet you all have played a Minecraft server, if it isnt obvious yet. Now, to connect to a Minecraft "server", you need to use the Server Address A.K.A the IP Address with Port. Now what *is* a server, and how are you joining it even thought its not in your pc, and you can connect with other people/friends? That is what we are gonna learn (Ya, Im doing this).

## What is a Server?
As you have doubted, this server is not on your computer. But on someone else's! Yes, so you are connecting to another computer and playing Minecraft which is running there. 

## What is IP address and Port?
So, since you are connecting to another person's computer, you are using the Internet for it. And for each Wi-Fi router, there is one address, a kind of numbers like `123.432.12.123`, just like your house does. Now ports, think of a port like a special door for your Minecraft server. Minecraft servers usually use port 25565 (unless specified (IP + Port = `123.432.12.123:25563`)). When you connect to a server, your game knocks on this door (port). The server opens the door and lets you in! 

A Port is opened in a person's computer, so that "you" can access it. But, there is a different way to this, called Port forwarding, we will look into this later.

## How is the IP text then?
You have probably seen that the IP address you type is (almost) always text, rather than numbers. Well, look I am right, but this is different. The so-called text uses a thing called "Domain", its like, the most useful feature of the Internet. But then, how does this "Domain" relate to IP? That's by DNS (Domain Name System) Records. By specifying one, you can tell the domain to connect to this such IP address. Normally, this domain (usually with a subdomain) connects to an IP Address + Port. 

## How are we connecting to another Computer?
Internet, is basically the answer. All the activities that you see using the Internet, is always in somebody else's computer. But, its not always their *Personal Computer*. They use computers that they turn on 24/7 and connected to the Internet, which they rarely use for anything else. If you have still doubts about "Internet", go look it up in Youtube or something, and btw, all the content in YouTube is stored in their own servers (computers).

## How do we connect to another Minecraft?
As said, you need to open a port for Minecraft for someone to connect. When you enter an IP address, Minecraft listens/follows to this IP address and through the port, in which they find the server. When a player connects to a server, it sends packets to you and back through, in lighting speed, which allows a perfect communication between the Server and the Client(the player's computer). This is how you are able to see other people through this, and Entities on the server very smoothly (but only if you have a good internet).
But, how do you open a "port"? And thats by Port Forwarding. You can open a port in such way using your router's configuration website. But, this allows anyone to enter, so its recommended to make sure that you have proper Firewall against this. 
Or you can use Server Hosts. Server Hosts are probably your best friends, in which, another person, using their own computer, opened a port and allows anyone to make a server through proper configurations, in it. This also makes everything better as server's needing higher power and faster networks can use this and any security problem is on their end. Also, they usually make server hosting way easier than it already is. Server Hosts can either be free, or paid using (usually) subscription on each month/year. As expected, free servers have less reliability and power considering paid alternatives, as most wont just allow anyone on their computer and use their resource *for free*. But, what if you dont have any money to spend, where can you host a server? Dont worry, there are tons of free server hosts, and probably the most common is Aternos. BUT, they are not the best. If you really want free, and reliable as much as it can be, you can find good ones in Lists like [FMHL](https://myuui.com) or [FLHL](https://flhl.whiteik.xyz/). 

Why did I make this? FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. If you have more questions, just google it or search in youtube it. Alot of this common knowledge nowadays.
